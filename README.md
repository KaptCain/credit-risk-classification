# credit-risk-classification
module 20 challenge
The purpose of this analysis was to predict whether a loan is "healthy" or "high-risk" based on financial data.
Accurate predictions are very important for risk management and informed decision-making in the lending industry.
The financial data included loan size, interest rate, borrower income, debt to income, number of accounts, dergogatory marks, and total amount of debt.
Using this information we predicted whether a loan was healthy or not. 
There were 15,001 "healthy" loans and 507 "unhealthy" loans.
